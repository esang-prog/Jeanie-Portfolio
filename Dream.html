        <p>When I was a little girl, I dreamed of becoming a CEO of a big company. I was inspired by TV shows where beautiful women owned or managed successful businesses. This sparked my ambition to start my own company and lead it as CEO. Even in high school, my dream remained unchanged. Building my own legacy became a driving force, and my love for K-dramas further fueled my desire to entrepreneurship.</p>
