            <h3>WORKS I</h3>
            <p>In my elementary days, I gained entrepreneurial experience by selling snacks and food to earn extra money, thereby reducing my reliance on my mother for pocket money.That entrepreneurial spirit continued into high school and senior high school, where I continued selling snacks, food, and candies to supplement my income. I even took on a part-time job as a dishwasher at a local eatery to boost my allowance, as our research expenses were substantial and we had numerous project-related costs due to our upcoming graduation. With multiple expenses to manage, including our immersion program in our chosen field, I sought out additional work opportunities, often returning home late due to extended work hours or late shifts.</p>

            <h3>LOVE II</h3>
            <p>Throughout my elementary and high school years, I never experienced a serious relationship. I had a few crushes, but nothing significant. In senior high, I had a long-distance relationship with a college student. Initially, everything was fine, as I was using my older sister's old phone. However, the phone suddenly broke, and I lost touch with him. Since then, I've never been in a relationship. Losing contact with him actually had a positive outcome â€“ it allowed me to focus on my studies without distraction.</p>

            <h3>SCHOOL III</h3>
            <p>During my elementary school days, I struggled with self-doubt, which significantly hindered my participation in class. Even when I knew the answer, I would hesitate to raise my hand, fearing that my response might be incorrect. This led to me becoming a passive listener, often chatting with my neighbor instead of engaging with the lesson. I lacked confidence in my abilities, frequently telling myself that I wouldn't be able to answer questions correctly, so there was no point in trying. As a result, I would often daydream or play games, even during class.My shyness also prevented me from standing up in front of my peers, even when I knew the answer. I would constantly discourage myself, doubting my capabilities. Unfortunately, this mindset took a toll on my grades, and I regret not being more courageous and confident in my academic pursuits. To make matters worse, I struggled with insecurity among my classmates. They seemed to tower over me with their tall stature and athletic builds, while I was self-conscious about my short height and malnourished appearance. I became the target of bullying, with cruel comments about my skinny frame, dark complexion, and petite stature. Despite the hurtful words, I tried to maintain a cheerful demeanor, often acting hyper and making jokes to deflect the bullying. However, it was a painful experience, and being fragile emotionally wasn't amusing. The bullying was particularly hurtful because my classmates didn't even know me well, yet they felt entitled to judge me. They would tease me for being weak if I didn't join in during rainy days when we'd typically play outside, simply because I was prone to fever. What made it even more difficult was that they didn't understand my situation ; they would mock me for being malnourished without realizing that my family wasn't lacking in food. In fact, I was taking vitamins to boost my height and weight, but unfortunately, my body just didn't cooperate.Those were difficult days filled with anxiety and self-doubt. However, things took a turn for the better when I reached senior high school. I managed to focus on my studies, and my hard work paid off as I became an honor student. Additionally, my weight became healthier compared to my elementary days.
